# XAccount Box

XAccount Box offers an intuitive interface for [XAccount contracts](https://github.com/ringecosystem/XAccount). It provides two key features:

1. **Create XAccount**: Create an XAccount for your connected wallet across multiple EVM networks.
2. **Generate actions**: Inspired by [Impersonator](https://impersonator.xyz/), XAccount Box helps produce cross-chain governance calls without manual binary encoding.
